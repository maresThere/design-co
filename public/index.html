          <p>I don't carry a gun. I wrote you everyday for a year. I think like a girl, I think. I love being Canadian.</p>

          <p>I think the one thing I love most about being an adult is the right to buy candy whenever and wherever I want. And its important to know that there are some changes you can't control and that there are others you can. </p>

          <p>But everytime that happens, what do you get? You get a new day. All my characters are me. I hear about actors who become the role and I think 'I wonder what that feels like'. I wrote you everyday for a year. I'm really not good at knowing what people want, because don't have that talent.</p>

        <div class="box4">
          <p>Anything a minute on either side of that and you're on your own. If ever I try to predict, I'm sure I will be instantly humbled. There's a hundred thousand streets in this city. Anything happens in that five minutes and I'm yours. Change moves in spirals, not circles. </p>
